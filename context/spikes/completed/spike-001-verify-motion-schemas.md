# Spike 001: Verify Motion Schemas and Interfaces

## Metadata
- **Type**: Investigation
- **Priority**: 🟠 High - Critical for API reliability
- **Time Box**: 6 hours maximum
- **Created**: 2025-08-15
- **Owner**: Developer
- **Status**: TODO

## Context
The Motion MCP Server implements 18+ API endpoints with TypeScript interfaces and schemas, but there may be misalignment between our type definitions and the actual Motion API documentation. This could lead to runtime errors, data loss, or unexpected behavior when the API returns different field structures than we expect.

Recent work has revealed potential gaps:
- Task 006 fixed MotionStatus interface mismatches
- Several APIs added recently (schedules, custom fields, recurring tasks) need verification
- Complex nested objects (chunks, assignees, projects) may have incomplete typing
- Response validation is in place but may be lenient about missing/extra fields

## Related Items
- Feature: API Completeness (epic-001-f02)
- Issue: Potential schema mismatches causing runtime errors
- Context: All recently implemented APIs need verification

## Questions to Answer

### Primary Questions
- [ ] Do our MotionTask, MotionProject, MotionWorkspace interfaces match the actual API responses?
- [ ] Are all required fields properly marked as required vs optional in our interfaces?
- [ ] Do our create/update data interfaces include all available API parameters?

### Secondary Questions
- [ ] Are there missing fields in newer API implementations (schedules, custom fields, recurring tasks)?
- [ ] Do our enum values (priority, frequency, etc.) match the API's accepted values?
- [ ] Are our nested object interfaces (chunks, assignees, etc.) complete and accurate?
- [ ] Do our error response interfaces match actual API error structures?

## Success Criteria

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All primary questions have documented answers
- [ ] Complete audit of all 18+ API endpoints against official documentation
- [ ] List of identified schema mismatches with severity assessment
- [ ] Recommendations for fixing critical and high-priority issues
- [ ] Time box was respected (≤6 hours)

### Deliverables
- [ ] Comprehensive schema audit report
- [ ] Prioritized list of schema fixes needed
- [ ] Updated interfaces/schemas for critical issues
- [ ] Documentation of API field mappings and discrepancies

## Investigation Plan

### Approach
1. **Document Current State** (1h)
   - Catalog all Motion API endpoints we're calling
   - List all current TypeScript interfaces and schemas
   - Document validation configurations

2. **Motion API Documentation Review** (2h)
   - Access official Motion API documentation
   - Document actual API response structures for each endpoint
   - Note required vs optional fields, data types, enum values

3. **Schema Comparison Analysis** (2h)
   - Compare our interfaces field-by-field with API docs
   - Identify missing fields, incorrect types, wrong optionality
   - Check create/update parameter completeness

4. **Validation & Recommendations** (1h)
   - Categorize issues by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
   - Create fix recommendations with effort estimates
   - Update critical schemas if time permits

### Resources to Consult
- Motion API Official Documentation (https://docs.usemotion.com/api)
- Current TypeScript interfaces in src/types/motion.ts
- API validation schemas in src/schemas/motion.ts
- Actual API responses from existing implementations

### Tools/Methods

### Schema Audit Results

**CRITICAL FINDINGS:**

1. **Task API Mismatches**
   - ❌ Missing field: `meta` object with pagination info (nextCursor, pageSize)
   - ❌ Missing field: `teamId` in workspace object
   - ❌ Labels structure: API returns `{name: string}` objects, we expect `string[]`
   - ❌ Chunks structure: Missing fields `isFixed`, different field names
   - ❌ CustomFieldValues structure mismatch: API returns `{type: string, value: any}`, we use `Record<string, unknown>`
   - ⚠️ Duration type: Can be `"NONE"` or `"REMINDER"` strings, not just number
   - ⚠️ Status can be object or string (inconsistent)

2. **Project API Mismatches**
   - ❌ Missing field: `meta` object with pagination
   - ❌ CustomFieldValues structure same issue as Tasks
   - ⚠️ Missing field: `color` (optional but not in API docs)
   - ✅ Status object structure correct

3. **Workspace API Issues**
   - ❌ Missing field: `teamId` (required in API)
   - ✅ Basic fields (id, name, type) correct

4. **Response Wrapper Issues**
   - ❌ List endpoints return `{meta: {...}, [resource]: [...]}` not direct arrays
   - ❌ Our ListResponse interface doesn't match actual structure
   - ⚠️ Some endpoints wrapped, some not (inconsistent)

5. **User API**
   - ✅ Basic structure appears correct (id, name, email)
   - ⚠️ May have additional fields not documented

6. **Comments API Issues**
   - ❌ Response wrapped in `{meta: {...}, comments: [...]}`, not direct array
   - ❌ Missing field: `creator` object (id, name, email)
   - ❌ Field name mismatch: API returns `createdAt`, we have `createdAt` (optional)
   - ⚠️ No projectId in response (only taskId)

7. **Custom Fields API Issues**  
   - ❌ Completely wrong structure! API returns `{id, field}`, we expect `{id, name, type, options, required, workspaceId}`
   - ❌ Field type stored as `field` property, not `type`
   - ❌ API path is `/beta/workspaces/{workspaceId}/custom-fields` (BETA endpoint)
   - ❌ No direct array response, needs workspace in path

8. **Recurring Tasks API Issues**
   - ❌ Response wrapped in `{meta: {...}, tasks: [...]}` (NOTE: "tasks" not "recurringTasks")
   - ❌ Completely different structure than expected
   - ❌ Contains full task objects with creator, assignee, project, workspace
   - ❌ Missing recurrence configuration fields we defined
   - ❌ Has nested workspace with labels and statuses arrays

9. **Schedules API**
   - ✅ Direct array response (no wrapper)
   - ✅ Structure matches our interface perfectly
   - ✅ All fields present and correct types

10. **Statuses API**
   - ✅ Direct array response (no wrapper)
   - ✅ Structure matches our interface
   - ✅ All three fields present and correct

### Critical Issues Found

**Severity: CRITICAL (Will cause runtime errors)**
1. **Custom Fields API Completely Wrong** - Interface doesn't match API at all
2. **Recurring Tasks API Wrong Structure** - Expects recurrence config, gets full task objects
3. **Pagination Meta Missing** - Multiple list endpoints missing meta.nextCursor handling
4. **Labels Type Mismatch** - Expecting string[], receiving {name: string}[]
5. **Response Wrapper Inconsistency** - Some APIs wrapped, some not, no clear pattern
6. **Comments Missing Creator Field** - Will lose author information

**Severity: HIGH (Data loss or incorrect behavior)**
1. **Workspace teamId Missing** - Required field not captured
2. **Chunks Missing Fields** - Scheduling data incomplete
3. **Duration Type Union** - String literals not handled

**Severity: MEDIUM (Functionality gaps)**
1. **Status Inconsistency** - Sometimes string, sometimes object
2. **Missing Optional Fields** - Some features unavailable

### Documentation Gaps Identified

1. **Incomplete API Documentation** - Many endpoints lack detailed schema info
2. **Inconsistent Response Formats** - Some wrapped, some not, no clear pattern

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

### Summary
Our Motion API implementation has severe schema mismatches that ARE causing runtime errors and data loss. The Custom Fields and Recurring Tasks APIs have completely wrong interfaces that don't match the actual API at all. Additionally, response wrapper inconsistency (some wrapped with meta, some not) and missing pagination handling will cause failures. Of 10 API groups checked, only 2 (Schedules and Statuses) are fully correct. This is a critical issue requiring immediate attention.

### Priority Fixes Needed

**Phase 1: CRITICAL Fixes (1-2 days)**
1. **Rewrite Custom Fields API** - Complete interface overhaul
2. **Rewrite Recurring Tasks API** - Complete interface overhaul  
3. **Fix Comments API** - Add creator field, fix response wrapper
4. **Fix Response Wrappers** - Standardize handling of meta/pagination
5. **Fix Task/Project labels** - Change to `Array<{name: string}>`

**Phase 2: HIGH Priority (2-3 days)**
1. Add teamId to MotionWorkspace interface
2. Update chunks structure with all fields
3. Fix duration type to `number | "NONE" | "REMINDER"`
4. Implement proper pagination using meta.nextCursor

**Phase 3: MEDIUM Priority (1-2 days)**
1. Standardize status field handling (object vs string)
2. Add missing optional fields
3. Update validation schemas to match

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Create Type Guards** - Add runtime type checking for response variations
2. **Update Interfaces** - Fix all type definitions to match actual API
3. **Enhance Validation** - Use Zod schemas with proper structure
4. **Add Response Normalizers** - Transform API responses to consistent format
5. **Implement Tests** - Add response mocking to catch future issues

### Pros
- Improved type safety and runtime reliability
- Better developer experience with accurate interfaces
- Reduced risk of API integration bugs
- Enhanced validation coverage

### Cons
- Time investment required for thorough fixes
- Potential breaking changes to existing code
- May require updating multiple interface files

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Status Quo** - Keep current schemas - Risk: Runtime errors, data inconsistencies
2. **Gradual Updates** - Fix only critical issues - Risk: Partial improvements only
3. **Complete Overhaul** - Rewrite all schemas - Risk: High effort, potential new bugs
